# The Learning Trajectory: From Basics to Foundations

This path is designed to prevent gaps in knowledge by ensuring you've learned the prerequisite concepts before tackling a new subject.

## Phase 1: The Language of Mathematics üß†

This is the most critical phase. Mathematics is the language of science. Without a strong foundation here, everything that follows will be more difficult.

1.  **Arithmetic:** Master this before anything else.
    * **Topics:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, percentages, and the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). This is the absolute bedrock.

2.  **Pre-Algebra:** The bridge to symbolic representation.
    * **Topics:** The concept of variables ($x$, $y$), manipulating simple equations, integers, and properties of numbers (commutative, associative).

3.  **Algebra 1:** The fundamental tool for problem-solving.
    * **Topics:** Solving linear equations, systems of two equations, polynomials (adding, subtracting, multiplying), factoring polynomials, and quadratic equations. You will use this in every single scientific field.

4.  **Geometry:** The study of shape and space.
    * **Topics:** Lines, angles, triangles, circles, polygons, area, volume, and an introduction to logical proofs. This builds spatial reasoning skills crucial for physics and chemistry.

5.  **Algebra 2:** More advanced algebraic concepts.
    * **Topics:** Deepens your understanding of functions (linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic), complex numbers, and matrices. This is essential for modeling real-world phenomena.

6.  **Trigonometry:** The study of triangles and periodic functions.
    * **Topics:** Sine, cosine, tangent (and their inverses), the unit circle, and trigonometric identities. This is non-negotiable for physics.

## Phase 2: Higher Mathematics & The Tools of Science üõ†Ô∏è

With the fundamentals in place, you can now learn the mathematical tools that describe change and complex systems.

1.  **Pre-Calculus:** This course solidifies your knowledge from Algebra 2 and Trigonometry and formally introduces the concepts needed for Calculus.
    * **Topics:** Advanced functions, series and sequences, and an introduction to limits.

2.  **Calculus 1 (Differential Calculus):** The study of instantaneous rates of change.
    * **Prerequisites:** Flawless Algebra and Trigonometry.
    * **Topics:** **Limits**, **derivatives**, and their applications (e.g., optimization). This is the mathematical language used to describe motion, growth, and decay.

3.  **Calculus 2 (Integral Calculus):** The study of accumulation.
    * **Topics:** **Integrals** (the reverse of derivatives), and techniques of integration. This is used to calculate area, volume, and total accumulated change.

4.  **Linear Algebra:** The study of vectors and linear systems.
    * **Prerequisites:** Strong Algebra. Can often be learned in parallel with Calculus 2.
    * **Topics:** **Vectors**, **matrices**, systems of linear equations, and vector spaces. Essential for quantum mechanics, computer graphics, and machine learning.

5.  **Calculus 3 (Multivariable Calculus):** Extending calculus to 3D.
    * **Prerequisites:** Calculus 2.
    * **Topics:** Partial derivatives and multiple integrals. This is necessary for understanding fields in physics, like electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.

6.  **Differential Equations:** Creating models of scientific systems.
    * **Prerequisites:** Calculus 2 and some Linear Algebra.
    * **Topics:** Formulating and solving equations that involve derivatives. This is the heart of modeling in physics, engineering, and population biology.

## Phase 3: Foundational Physics ‚öõÔ∏è

With a strong math toolkit, you can now tackle the fundamental laws governing the universe.

1.  **Calculus-Based Classical Mechanics:** The study of motion.
    * **Prerequisites:** Calculus 1 & 2.
    * **Topics:** Kinematics, Newton's Laws of Motion, work, energy, momentum, and rotational dynamics. This is the direct application of your calculus skills.

2.  **Calculus-Based Electricity & Magnetism (E&M):** The study of fields and forces.
    * **Prerequisites:** Mechanics and Calculus 3.
    * **Topics:** Electric fields, magnetic fields, circuits, and Maxwell's Equations, which unify the two phenomena.

3.  **Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics:** The study of heat, energy, and entropy.
    * **Prerequisites:** Mechanics and Calculus.
    * **Topics:** The laws of thermodynamics, temperature, and how macroscopic properties (like pressure) arise from microscopic particle behavior.

## Phase 4 & 5: Chemistry and Biology üß¨

These sciences build directly upon the principles of physics and the language of math.

1.  **General Chemistry:** The study of matter and its properties.
    * **Prerequisites:** Strong Algebra 1 and a conceptual understanding of E&M and Thermodynamics from physics.
    * **Topics:** The atom, the periodic table, chemical bonds (a direct result of electromagnetic forces), stoichiometry (balancing equations), and chemical reactions (governed by thermodynamics).

2.  **Organic Chemistry:** The study of carbon-based compounds.
    * **Prerequisites:** General Chemistry.
    * **Topics:** The structure, properties, and reactions of organic molecules. This is the foundation for biochemistry.

3.  **General Biology:** The study of life.
    * **Prerequisites:** A solid foundation in Chemistry.
    * **Topics:** **Biochemistry** (the chemistry of life), cell biology, genetics, evolution, and physiology. You'll see how chemical principles govern everything from DNA replication to metabolism.
